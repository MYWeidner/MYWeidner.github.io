## Weekly Project Updates
---

### Week 1:
Status updates begin in week 2

### Week 2:
**What did you do last week?** 

I implemented my GitHub website with pages for homepage, proposal, weekly status, and final report. This website will be updated every week to track project status. I also researched and created my project proposal and posted it to Piazza. I will update this file based on suggestions from peers if applicable. 

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* Update existing resume and cover letter using tips from various sources. I'll use the resources on the CU website as a starting point.
* Upload resume to VMock for feedback
* Review LeetCode Beginner's Guide
* Solve easy problems from array section on LeetCode. If time permits, start working on medium problems. This plan also includes researching any problems I have issues with.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

No impediments to report this week. I have already carved out time the next several days to get this done.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

Last week I completed all of my work in one day. This plan was fine for what I needed to do, but going forward, I plan to work on my weekly goals on a daily basis. I want to push to work on these goals at least 1-2 hours per day as to not overwhelm myself.

### Week 3:
**What did you do last week?** 

I updated my resume using resources from CU’s website and a few templates I found online then I uploaded the file to VMock for feedback. My initial VMock score was 62% out of 100%. After implementing VMock’s suggestions I was able to push that score up to a 91%. Most of VMock’s suggestions centered around adding impact and scope of my work to the Experience and Projects sections. This tool was incredibly easy to use and helpful. CU students get full access with their CU identikey. There's an option to use the tool on a LinkedIn account so I'll check this out when I have free time.
 
I also created a cover letter. Most of the sites that I visited suggested that I write one although I’ve never actually needed one with my past job applications. I wrote the cover letter using templates I found tailored for software engineer applicants.

I also started exploring LeetCode array problems. I only had time to complete 2 problems so next week I need to step it up in this area.

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* Work LeetCode problems: arrays, strings, and linked list
* Soft skills [course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/speaking-confidently-and-effectively) 

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
The only impediment is time. I'm taking Data Science and an independent research project this semester which is taking more time than I anticipated.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
Last week I decided to work on this project at least an hour a day. I found that it was difficult to just "switch over" for an hour. Now I want to try to knock out as much data science work on Monday and Tuesday (reading, lectures, and quizzes) then switch back and forth between this project, data science assignment, and my research project the rest of the week. I'll report back next week if this works out better for me.
