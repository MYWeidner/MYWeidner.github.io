## Weekly Project Updates
---

### Week 1:
Status updates begin in week 2

### Week 2:
**What did you do last week?** 

I implemented my GitHub website with pages for homepage, proposal, weekly status, and final report. This website will be updated every week to track project status. I also researched and created my project proposal and posted it to Piazza. I will update this file based on suggestions from peers if applicable.Â 

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* Update existing resume and cover letter using tips from various sources. I'll use the resources on the CU website as a starting point.
* Upload resume to VMock for feedback
* Review LeetCode Beginner's Guide
* Solve easy problems from array section on LeetCode. If time permits, start working on medium problems. This plan also includes researching any problems I have issues with.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

No impediments to report this week. I have already carved out time the next several days to get this done.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

Last week I completed all of my work in one day. This plan was fine for what I needed to do, but going forward, I plan to work on my weekly goals on a daily basis. I want to push to work on these goals at least 1-2 hours per day as to not overwhelm myself.
