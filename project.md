## Project: Path to Becoming a Software Engineer After Graduation

---

### Vision statement: 
I'm graduating this summer and I need to prepare myself for interviews. This project will document the steps that I take while preparing, applying for jobs, and hopefully interviewing for those jobs. This project will expand both my soft skills and technical skills through focused practice and study.

### Motivation:
I set out to complete this program on the accelerated schedule which didn't leave much room for interview preparation. Now that I am closer to graduation, I need to put my energy toward finding a job. This project will guarantee that I carve out at least 4 hours per week toward this goal.

### Specific and measurable goals:
Starting in week 2, I'll work on coding problems in LeetCode. If I don't understand a concept, I'll watch videos/ read tutorials. Sources for this will really depend on what obstacles I run in to.  Most importantly, I'll time myself while working on these problems as I will not have unlimited time during a coding interview. My mentor last semester suggested that I also talk through my thought process out loud as I am working. This way, I get into the habit of doing this during an interview. I'll allow myself 20 minutes for easy problems, 30 minutes for medium problems, and 45 minutes for hard problems. I'll document what problems I worked, what I struggled with, and what I need to work on each week.

Soft skills preparation will be in form of LinkedIn courses. I'll also study the STAR method to help me craft my "stories" for the behavioral portion of the interview process. Note, I also added the milestone due dates to my schedule below.

### Risks to project completion:
1. Spending too much time on a topic
2. Not understanding the material/ having trouble solving problems

### Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above:
1. Stick to my plan to allow 20 minutes for easy problems, 30 minutes for medium problems, and 45 minutes for hard problems. I need to set a timer and stop when it goes off. Spinning my wheels on a problem is counterproductive and a waste of time.
2. Research problems I struggle with by watching videos or reading tutorials. Do this immediately after getting stuck on a problem and then go back to the problem and try again.

### Project Assessments:
* Keep weekly notes on my progress, struggles, and suggested changes to the tentative schedule above
* Work problems on LeetCode and track progress through various topics on a weekly basis
