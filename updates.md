## Weekly Project Updates
---

### Week 1:
Status updates begin in week 2

### Week 2:
**What did you do last week?** 

I implemented my GitHub website with pages for homepage, proposal, weekly status, and final report. This website will be updated every week to track project status. I also researched and created my project proposal and posted it to Piazza. I will update this file based on suggestions from peers if applicable. 

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* Update existing resume and cover letter using tips from various sources. I'll use the resources on the CU website as a starting point.
* Upload resume to VMock for feedback
* Review LeetCode Beginner's Guide
* Solve easy problems from array section on LeetCode. If time permits, start working on medium problems. This plan also includes researching any problems I have issues with.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

No impediments to report this week. I have already carved out time the next several days to get this done.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

Last week I completed all of my work in one day. This plan was fine for what I needed to do, but going forward, I plan to work on my weekly goals on a daily basis. I want to push to work on these goals at least 1-2 hours per day as to not overwhelm myself.

### Week 3:
**What did you do last week?**  

I updated my resume using resources from CU’s website and a few templates I found online then I uploaded the file to VMock for feedback. My initial VMock score was 62% out of 100%. After implementing VMock’s suggestions I was able to push that score up to a 91%. Most of VMock’s suggestions centered around adding impact and scope of my work to the Experience and Projects sections. This tool was incredibly easy to use and helpful. CU students get full access with their CU identikey. There's an option to use the tool on a LinkedIn account so I'll check this out when I have free time.
 
I also created a cover letter. Most of the sites that I visited suggested that I write one although I’ve never actually needed one with my past job applications. I wrote the cover letter using templates I found tailored for software engineer applicants.

I also started exploring LeetCode array problems. I only had time to complete 2 problems so next week I need to step it up in this area.

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* Work LeetCode problems: arrays, strings, and linked list
* Soft skills [course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/speaking-confidently-and-effectively) 

**Are there any impediments in your way?**
The only impediment is time. I'm taking Data Science and an independent research project this semester which is taking more time than I anticipated.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
Last week I decided to work on this project at least an hour a day. I found that it was difficult to just "switch over" for an hour. Now I want to try to knock out as much data science work on Monday and Tuesday (reading, lectures, and quizzes) then switch back and forth between this project, data science assignment, and my research project the rest of the week. I'll report back next week if this works out better for me.

### Week 4:
**What did you do last week?** 

Last week I spent some time working LeetCode problems. Specifically, I worked all the questions in the Array [collection](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/). In this collection most of the questions are categorized as easy and there are a couple of medium questions. My approach was to attempt to solve the questions in 20 minutes. If I couldn't solve them, then I looked through the discussion until I found ideas to make my solution work or just Googled ideas until I understood what I was doing. I also watched the video for the problem on [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode/videos) whether I was able to solve it on my own or not. NeetCode is a useful channel that explains solutions with examples then walks you through the code. It's a good way to learn another approach to solving a problem. In a few instances, NeetCode used a similar approach to what I did to solve the problem.

[My Array Notes](./CodingPractice/Arrays.docx)

I also watched a LinkedIn training [video](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/expert-tips-for-answering-common-interview-questions/salary-negotiation-approach-and-tips) on interviewing techniques. I highly recommend this training as it teaches you how to answer the most common behavioral interview questions and has examples of people answering the questions with critiques on how they can improve. I signed up for the free 30 trial of LinkedIn Learning to watch the video.

[Certificate of Completion](./CertOfCompl/BehaviorQuestions.pdf)

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* Soft skills [training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/interpersonal-communication/interpersonal-communication)
* LeetCode - solve as many problems as possible for strings, linked list, and trees category
* Apply for jobs

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

No impediments.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

Spending the first half of the week concentrating on 1 class and my independent research project really helped. I spent the rest of the week and some of the weekend switching back and forth. I'm going to proceed with this schedule and report back if it starts to become a problem.

### Week 5:
**What did you do last week?** 

Last week I spent a couple of days working through the strings section in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/). I've been pretty good about sticking to my timing rule. I work the problem on my own for 20 minutes. If I get a working solution great, but if I don't then I check out the discussion page in LeetCode for hints. If I still don't get a working solution, I try YouTube. The NeetCode channel has been a great resource and I find myself watching the videos just to get a second of third way to solve the same problem.

Just like I did with the array section, I am linking my notes so that other students can use them if they'd like.

[Progress Report](./CodingPractice/Progress/Strings.png)

[My Strings Notes](./CodingPractice/Strings.docx)

I also watched a LinkedIn Learning video on interpersonal communication. One thing I found interesting is that people give you subtle non-verbal clues when they are ready to leave a conversation. For example, someone who is ready to leave the room and the conversation may start pointing their feet toward the exit. The video is on the shorter side (37 minutes) and I think there may be better videos out there. I found this video more comedic than helpful to be honest. The one thing I did get out of the experience is the realization that I should be spending my time watching videos on interviewing techniques and mock interviews, so I updated my proposal to reflect this change.

[Certificate of Completion](./CertOfCompl/InterpersonalCommunication.pdf)

I applied to 4 jobs this week. Right now, I am using Indeed and LinkedIn, but I also need to start checking Handshake. There's an overwhelming amount of entry level jobs out there, unfortunately, many of them list 2-3 years of experience necessary. How is that entry level?

Lastly, I updated my website to reflect my LeetCode schedule and additional videos I'd like to watch. More on the LeetCode schedule below.

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* LeetCode - [linked lists](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/)
* Soft skills - [course1](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/job-interview-tips-for-software-engineers/overview-of-software-engineering-roles?u=42275329)
                [course2](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/get-ready-for-your-coding-interview/the-coding-interview?u=42275329)
* Apply for jobs
  * Contact the leads that a friend gave me
  * Apply to open reqs - start checking Handshake as well

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

No impediments.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

I found that my capacity right now for LeetCode practice is one section a week. I want to review my notes from the week before, so I think doing one section every week is a good pace.

### Week 6:
**What did you do last week?** 

Last week was a busy week with other course work and an exam so I was not able to keep up the same pace as previous weeks.

I watched 2 LinkedIn Learning videos both of which I would recommend. The first is [Job Interview Tips for SWE](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/job-interview-tips-for-software-engineers/overview-of-software-engineering-roles?u=42275329). The run time is 44 minutes. This video walks you through how to approach common questions asked during software engineer interviews. There are also examples of people answering these questions. I liked this video because it was specifically for SWE jobs so the responses were applicable to what I would be interviewing for. I have some time earmarked in future weeks to start writing responses for behavioral questions, so this video was a good place to start.

The second video is Get Ready for [Your Coding Interview](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/get-ready-for-your-coding-interview/the-coding-interview?u=42275329). The runtime is 1 hour 50 minutes, but you'll end up going longer if you try the exercises on your own. I highly recommend this video as a good starting point for those of us that are just starting out with coding interview prep. I'm only a few weeks in so I felt it was still good information. The video walks you through a tutorial of arrays (both 1D and 2D), strings, dictionaries/ hash tables, complexity, and big O notation. It's a good refresher and conceptually, it was not difficult material. The course provides you with Jupyter notebooks to use. You are also given coding practice problems to solve, and the video walks you through possible solutions complete with code and complexity explanations. The coding questions are not super difficult (I would say they would be marked as easy in LeetCode), but it gets you thinking on how you can approach the problems when you're on the spot during an interview. The presenter stresses the need to ask your coding interviewer questions and even gives examples as to what he would ask. The biggest take aways was that I need to be prepared to think out loud, ask questions before I dive into problem solving, and be able to walk the interviewer through my thought process on paper or white board before I start coding. You must be able to explain yourself clearly since the interviewer wants to "see" how you think.

I applied to 7 jobs this week. I started using Handshake as well as Indeed and LinkedIn. I mentioned last week the overwhelming number of jobs out there for entry level positions that require years of experience. I updated my searches to include new grad and associate positions and applied to a few of those. Let's see if I hear anything back. I also reached out to some contacts that a friend gave me. I think these leads might be dead ends as they are currently only hiring for in office positions and I don't live on the East coast, but it doesn't hurt to make a connection.

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* Update my project timeline to reflect new LeetCode schedule 
* LeetCode - [linked lists](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/)
* Review coding notes from previous weeks
* Soft skills - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/interviewing-techniques-2019/interview-techniques-to-attract-the-best-talent?u=42275329)
                [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw)
* Apply for jobs

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

No impediments.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

I like the process that I am using now. Last week I didn't have as much time to dedicate to LeetCode problem solving, but I'm planning to make it up this week. I still believe one section a week is a good pace.

### Week 7:
**What did you do last week?** 

Last week, I studied my LeetCode string and array notes. I also completed the [linked list](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/) section in LeetCode. I spent some time watching the NeetCode videos for each of the linked list problems that I worked. It's been a long time since I worked linked list problems so I'm rusty here and need to practice more. I tripped myself up on pointer updating. 

If you haven't heard of the tortoise and the hare algorithm for detecting cycles in linked lists, you should watch the NeetCode [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBTe7lFR3vc). It does a good job explaining why the time complexity is always O(n). I also found a good resource that outlines the [common patterns](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed) that can be used to solve coding interview questions. The article provides tips on when to use each algorithm, so I'll have to keep this in mind as I keep studying.

[Progress Report](./CodingPractice/Progress/LinkedList.png)

[My Linked List Notes](./CodingPractice/LinkedList.docx)

I watched a couple of mock coding interview videos on YouTube. The key takeaway here is that we should be constantly communicating during a coding interview. We must ask questions, talk about strategy, and walk the interviewer through how the algorithm should work using an example.

[Video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw)   
[Video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yju4zwKSriI)   

I also applied to 3 jobs this week. I found that every job that I have applied to has the option to add a cover letter. I wrote my cover letter in such a way that I can easily tweak it for each potential employer.

**What do you plan to do this week?** 
* LeetCode
  * [Additional linked list problems](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)  
  * [Trees](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/94/trees/)
* Access to lifelong learning deliverable
* Apply for jobs
* Update project weekly schedule to add additional linked list problems in week 7

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

No impediments.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

I like the process that I am using and plan to stick with it. Given my work load this summer, working one topic in LeetCode a week is as much as I can handle.

### Week 8 - Mid-Semester Project Update:
With only a few weeks remaining in the semester, it's a good time to reflect on the status of my project in relation to the goals and schedule that I proposed. 

Accomplishments:
* I've been deligently working coding problems from LeetCode's Easy [Collection](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/) every week and have been keeping notes describing the strategy for solving each problem, time and space complexity, and screenshots of my solution.
  * Sections completed (see [notes](./codingnotes))
    * Array
    * Strings
    * Linked List
    * Trees (completed last week)
* I used VMock to optimize my resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn profile.
* I watched several hours of LinkedIn Learning and YouTube videos designed to prepare me for interviews.
* I applied to 19 jobs thus far. I did receive a call back yesterday to schedule an interview. I haven't heard back on an official date.

Strategy:  

Every week, I selected a section of LeetCode coding problems to work. I gave myself 20 minutes to try and solve the problem myself. Sometimes I was able to come up with a solution in that timeframe, but other times I could not. The intention behind the timeframe was so that I wouldn't get stuck working a problem for hours since I have a limited amount of time to prepare for coding interviews. I looked up the solution on YouTube for every problem I worked and documented the solution if it was different from what I had come up with. I found that it was more helpful to work a problem on paper first before trying to code.

In the last couple of weeks, I've been trying to review my notes before starting on a new section. Ideally, I would like to go back and rework these problems. 

Updated schedule:  

I have been updating my tentative schedule as needed on my [Project Proposal page](./project). I want to start working more difficult problems from the [LeetCode 75 study plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/). I updated my schedule based on this new study plan. Since the problems will be more difficult, I'll allow myself 30 minutes before looking for a solution if my workload in other classes allows.
